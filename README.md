# Spam-E-mail-detector


## Overview
This is a machine learning-based project designed to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham) using natural language processing and predictive modeling. The detector analyzes email content to identify spam patterns, providing a practical tool for email filtering and security. It leverages a trained model to deliver reliable predictions based on text data.

## Features
- **Spam Detection**: Classifies emails as spam or ham with high accuracy.
- **Text Analysis**: Processes email content using NLP techniques.
- **Customizable**: Can be trained on custom datasets for improved performance.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for inputting email text and receiving results.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Core programming language.
  
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
- NLTK/Spacy: For natural language processing and text preprocessing.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization (optional, if included).
- Jupyter Notebook (optional): For development and testing.



## Usage
- Input Data: Provide email text through the script or notebook interface.
- Prediction: The model outputs a classification (e.g., "Spam" or "Ham").
- Accuracy: 95%
